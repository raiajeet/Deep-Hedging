In quantitative finance, one of the famous Black-Scholes models is useful for traders in their estimations of options prices. But there are some flaws in this model, like the model works only in a perfect market and we know that the market is generally not perfect, which is just an assumption. Implied volatility, which tells us about the movement of the market, leaves a ripple effect in the underlying asset, and the movement of the underlying asset is passed on to the options
price. Implied volatility has been ignored in this model. For these reasons, Black-Scholes models cannot be used fully, but yes, they can be used for approximation and as a benchmark. In this project, we are using deep hedging, where we can predict the delta using current stage delta and market data.
